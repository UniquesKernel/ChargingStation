\section{ResubmissionChanges}

Below is listed the changes we have made to the report and code for resubmission.
They cover further explanation of our design, adding a test for the log and expanding the tests of chargeControl.\\

One comment on our work was \emph{"ChargeControl dosen't show that it is charging when current (5$<$current=$>$500)"} and that BVA and EP was not used in testing ChargeControl.\\

We agree that the testing did not do a complete BVA of ChargeControl. This has been fixed. We do, however, disagree that ChargeControl doesn't show charging when current is between 5 and 500. We do not send a "charging" message to the display, as this message has already been sent when the startCharge function was called, and there is therefore no point in sending the "charging" message again.\\

We have of cource tested the behaviour (and as mentioned above, added more tests) \\


\textbf{Sections added:}

1 . Test Design. 

Added More text to:\\

Reflections on RFID event firing double.\\ 

Code Added: 

Added more BVA tests:
\begin{itemize}
\item testMinimumChargingCurrent()
\item testAboveMinimumChargingCurrent()
\item testBelowMinimumChargingCurrent()
\item testChargingMaxAllowed()
\item testChargingBelowMaxAllowed()
\item testChargingAboveMaxAllowed()
\end{itemize}


Added ZOMBIE MANY tests: 
\begin{itemize}
