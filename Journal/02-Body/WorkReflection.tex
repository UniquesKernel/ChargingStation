\section{Work Distribution Reflection}

At the start of the project the group worked together to make and 
understand the overall design of the system, based on the assignment 
handout. We then distributed the modules evenly between us and implemented
and tested them individually. The \textit{stationControl} module was left
out, as this module is at the centre of the system and we felt that it would
be best if all group members understood this module well. We therefore designed
and wrote this part in colser colaboration than was pressent during the 
development of the other modules.\\

This approach of divide and conquer, with an occational "concentration of force"
has worked well for the group, allowing us to work as suited the individual best,
but also taking advantage of the small group size to be able to work "all hands on deck" on the key elements.
